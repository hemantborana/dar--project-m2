# MongoDB vs Key-Value Stores (Redis)
MongoDB stores JSON-like documents.
Redis stores data as key → value pairs only.
MongoDB supports queries, indexing, aggregation.
Redis is ultra-fast but limited query capability.

# MongoDB vs Column-Family (Cassandra)
MongoDB is document based.
Cassandra stores rows inside column-families.
MongoDB supports dynamic fields.
Cassandra best for huge write throughput.
Both scale horizontally, but Cassandra has no JOIN-like operations.
