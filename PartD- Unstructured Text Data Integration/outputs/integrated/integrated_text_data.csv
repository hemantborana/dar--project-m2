DOC_0001,Wikipedia,Artificial intelligence,Artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: ""A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."" Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.",artificial intelligence ai is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg language models and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception and support for roboticsa to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economicsb ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields some companies such as openai google deepmind and meta aim to create artificial general intelligence agi ai that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture in the 2020s an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom generative ais ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms ethical concerns have been raised about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology,402,2808,26,5.99,2025-12-08 09:06:32,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,encyclopedia,"intelligence, artificial, learning, research, that",Long,Wikipedia,2025-12-08 09:06:32,2025-12-08 09:15:02,English,Plain Text,Clean,encyclopedia,Public,1 year
DOC_0002,Wikipedia,Machine learning,Machine learning,"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance. ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics. Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework.",machine learning ml is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions within a subdiscipline in machine learning advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks a class of statistical algorithms to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance ml finds application in many fields including natural language processing computer vision speech recognition email filtering agriculture and medicine the application of ml to business problems is known as predictive analytics statistics and mathematical optimisation mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis eda via unsupervised learning from a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework,165,1216,9,6.38,2025-12-08 09:06:37,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,encyclopedia,"learning, machine, data, field, study",Long,Wikipedia,2025-12-08 09:06:37,2025-12-08 09:15:02,English,Plain Text,Clean,encyclopedia,Public,1 year
DOC_0003,Wikipedia,Data science,Data science,"Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data. Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession. Data science is ""a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a ""fourth paradigm"" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that ""everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology"" and the data deluge. Data science is often described as a multidisciplinary field because it draws on techniques from diverse areas, such as computer science, statistics, information science, and other subject-specific disciplines. Some researchers say that the combination of the different fields is similar to how information science was decades ago (Mayernik, 2023). These similarities help us understand how data science became its own field of study.",data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics scientific computing scientific methods processing scientific visualization algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy structured or unstructured data data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain eg natural sciences information technology and medicine data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science a research paradigm a research method a discipline a workflow and a profession data science is a concept to unify statistics data analysis informatics and their related methods to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data it uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics statistics computer science information science and domain knowledge however data science is different from computer science and information science turing award winner jim gray imagined data science as a fourth paradigm of science empirical theoretical computational and now datadriven and asserted that everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology and the data deluge data science is often described as a multidisciplinary field because it draws on techniques from diverse areas such as computer science statistics information science and other subjectspecific disciplines some researchers say that the combination of the different fields is similar to how information science was decades ago mayernik 2023 these similarities help us understand how data science became its own field of study,232,1678,13,6.24,2025-12-08 09:06:38,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science,encyclopedia,"science, data, information, from, statistics",Long,Wikipedia,2025-12-08 09:06:38,2025-12-08 09:15:02,English,Plain Text,Clean,encyclopedia,Public,1 year
